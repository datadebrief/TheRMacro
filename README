4. Extract the zip file to your "My Macros" (or similar) directory
5. Launch EmEditor and select the Macros menu; then "customize"; then "new". Select "thermacro.jsee" ONLY. Click ok.
6. You may need to edit two variables in the macro, "#icon" and "rbin"
6.1. Click the "Macros" menu again, and select "edit thermacro";
6.2 "#icon" - this should be the first line, the default is "C:\Program Files\R\R-2.11.0\bin\R.exe", you might need to change that depending on the path to your r.exe, don't forget to keep the trailing comma and 0. 
6.3 "rbin" - this should be the fifth line, the default is 'C:\\Program Files\\R\\R-2.11.0\\bin\\', again, you might need to change this depending on your version of R and where it is installed. You need to put double slashes in the path and don't frget the trailing slashes.
6.4 Click save and you should be done!
7. To test if it can find your R executables, click on the macro and select R Gui -> Start; or R Term -> Start, and you should see the program launched. If an error occurs, it will be shown in EmEditor's output bar.
